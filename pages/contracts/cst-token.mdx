# CST Token

CST is Coset's ERC20 token. It is designed to work well with **x402** by supporting **EIP-3009** (gas-abstracted transfers).

You can find the deployed address on the [Contracts List](/contracts/list).

## Basics

- Name: `Coset`
- Symbol: `CST`
- Decimals: `6`
- Initial supply: `1,000,000 CST` minted to the initial owner at deployment

## Why EIP-3009 matters

Coset uses **EIP-3009** so a transfer can be authorized via an off-chain signature and executed on-chain by someone else (e.g. a relayer / Coset node).

The token supports:

- `transferWithAuthorization(...)`
- `receiveWithAuthorization(...)` (payee must be the caller)
- `cancelAuthorization(...)`
- `authorizationState(authorizer, nonce)`

Notes:

- Each authorization uses a `nonce` and a `[validAfter, validBefore]` time window.
- A nonce can be used only once (used or canceled).

## EIP-712 / permit helpers

The CST token also exposes standard EIP-712 metadata through the underlying permit implementation.

- `permit(...)` (EIP-2612)
- `version()` (returns the EIP-712 version string)
