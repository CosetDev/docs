# Coset

Coset is a public oracle service designed to make off-chain data open, permissionless, and easy to monetize. Instead of relying on a small number of trusted providers, Coset allows anyone to create an oracle and provide data to applications.

In Coset, data providers use their private endpoints to communicate with Coset relayer node and provide data. Users can read data from the oracle contract, or use the Coset SDK. When a data update is required, the request responds with HTTP 402 (Payment Required). The requester completes the payment, and data is delivered.

Payments are made using USDC or the CST token. Data providers get paid instantly when a fresh data is requested.

Coset treats data as a public resource with an open market. Developers get reliable data when they need it, and providers are rewarded instantly for keeping their data up to date.
