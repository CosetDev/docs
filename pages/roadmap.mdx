# Roadmap

Coset is an MVP, but it is not flawless yet. Our first goal is to make it perfect.

## MVP

- Our first priority is to make Coset solid and reliable.
- Fix remaining issues and edge cases
- Improve performance, security, and overall stability
- Refine developer experience and documentation
- Expand oracle contract templates to support multiple data types instead of a single one, improving scalability
- Improve the x402 library and our facilitator to support native currency payments (e.g. MNT on Mantle, CRO on Cronos)

## Mainnet Launch & Beyond

- Once the MVP is fully stable, we will move to mainnet.
- Deploy Coset on mainnet
- Launch the native CST token and bridge to all supported networks on platform
- Enable native token payments on mainnet
- Explore deployment on other EVM-compatible networks
- Support CST as a multichain native token
