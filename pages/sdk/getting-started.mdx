# Getting Started

After we installed the dependencies, we can start using Coset SDK.

Start by importing the SDK in your project:

```typescript
import { Coset, Networks, PaymentToken } from "@coset-dev/sdk";
```

`Coset` is the main class that we will use to interact with the Coset protocol.

`Networks` and `PaymentToken` are enums that help us specify the network and payment token we want to use.

In Coset SDK, every instance is tied to a specific oracle. So, we need to provide the oracle address when creating a Coset instance.

For this example, we will use a [CST-USDT price feed oracle](https://coset.dev/oracle/696a00d4a2c1543d52568f12) deployed on Mantle Sepolia Testnet. You can use whatever oracle address you want. You can search for oracles at [Coset App](https://coset.dev).

Now we can create a Coset instance:

```typescript
const coset = new Coset(
    Networks.MANTLE_TESTNET,
    PaymentToken.USDC,
    "0xEfB607f0656c7d8B0a23401e2AE6f4DaAfD7fe35", // Oracle Address
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}` // Wallet Private Key
);
```

Here, we created a new Coset instance on Mantle Sepolia Testnet, using USDC as the payment token. We also provided a private key for signing transactions.

Wallet private key is required for data updates. Be sure you have enough USDC or CST token on chosen network.

Another example on Cronos Testnet with CST as payment token:

```typescript
const coset = new Coset(
    Networks.CRONOS_TESTNET,
    PaymentToken.CST,
    "0x6901eC8570005867DFA1AFE7Fe6F0B374884cb5D", // Oracle Address
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}` // Wallet Private Key
);
```

[This oracle](https://coset.dev/oracle/696f9bbc1aca83d52933ec0d) returns Bitcoin price when requested.

And now we can start reading data from oracles and call data updates.
