# Creating an Oracle

To create an oracle, you need a:

- Name
- Description
- Update price (this will affect the money you earn from your service)
- Private API Endpoint
- Recommended update duration (optional)

If a recommended update duration is provided, this will help data readers to decide whether they should update the oracle or not.

To deploy the oracle, you have to give authorization to transfer tokens for oracle deployment.

After paying the one-time deployment fee, you have your own oracle! You can manage your oracles at one place.
